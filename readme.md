# WebSockets Basics

## Introduction
This repository contains resources and code examples to help you understand the basics of WebSockets. WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, allowing for real-time data transfer between a client and a server.

## What are WebSockets?
WebSockets are a protocol that enables interactive communication between a web browser and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets allow for continuous two-way communication, making them ideal for applications like chat applications, online gaming, and live notifications.

## Key Features
- **Full-Duplex Communication**: Allows for simultaneous data transmission in both directions.
- **Low Latency**: Reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection for each message.
- **Event-Driven**: Supports real-time updates with minimal effort.

## Getting Started
To get started with WebSockets, ensure you have the following:
- A web browser (for client-side code).
- A server-side language (Node.js is commonly used).
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and networking concepts.
